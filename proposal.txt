3 Data Flow Architecture
3.1 Ingestion (The “Senses”)
• Unstructured data from social scrapers monitoring “Benglish” keywords on TikTok
and Facebook (e.g., viral trends).
1
• Structured real-time logs from Shopify/Daraz APIs and bKash payments.
• Contextual inputs such as Weather API for monsoon alerts and Bangladesh Bureau
of Statistics for regional economics.
• Event-driven streaming via Apache Kafka/Redpanda for high concurrency.
3.2 Processing (The “Nerve Center”)
• Data normalized into a Feature Store (Snowflake).
• Unstructured social data embedded in a Vector Database (Weaviate) for semantic
matching.
• Past conversations stored for contextual memory.
3.3 Synthesis (The “Mind”)
• GraphRAG for relationship mapping (e.g., product bundles in specific regions).
• Causal inference using DoWhy to distinguish causal effects, improving forecast ac curacy beyond correlations.
4 AI Core and Decision Engine Design
4.1 Demand Forecasting (Ensemble Model)
• NeuralProphet for advanced seasonality (Eid, Pohela Boishakh).
• XGBoost/LSTM for short-term sales velocity prediction.
• Llama 3 (70B) for sentiment correction from social data (e.g., boosting forecast by
15% on positive reviews).
4.2 Dynamic Pricing Agent (Reinforcement Learning)
• Contextual Bandit algorithm explores price points (e.g., Tk 500 vs. 550).
• Ethical bounds restrict harmful or predatory pricing.
• RLHF-enhanced negotiation tactics.
2
4.3 Recommendation Engine (Graph Neural Network)
• Built using PyTorch Geometric.
• Suggests region-specific bundles (e.g., “Umbrellas + waterproof spray in rainy Chit tagong”).
• Risk scoring for COD fraud using order history and blacklists.
4.4 Orchestrator
• LangGraph coordinates agent swarm:
– Analyst Agent
– Negotiator Agent
– Risk Agent
• Ensures looped, reliable multi-step reasoning.
5 Key Features & User Experience
5.1 TrendSeq (Social-to-Shelf)
• Detects viral products on TikTok/Reels.
• WhatsApp alert example: “Green velvet sarees trending in Dhanmondi. Order
sample? (Y/N)”
5.2 PriceShift & Haggling Engine
• Auto-adjusts for competitor prices.
• Negotiates in natural conversations: “Can’t do 500, but 520 for two? Deal?”
5.3 Inventory Copilot & Stockout Pre-Cognition
• Predicts stockouts 7 days ahead using GNN ripple effects.
• Example: “Blue shirts low in 4 days due to supplier delay.”
5.4 COD Shield
• Scores orders for fraud risk.
• >80% risk auto-converts to advance payment.

5.5 Bhai-Bot & Magic Descriptions
• Multilingual voice assistant (Bangla-English mix).
• Questions like: “Ei mashe labh koto?”
• Auto-generates SEO descriptions from product photos.
5.6 UX Focus
• Voice-first experience.
• WhatsApp-integrated for maximum accessibility.
• “Why?” explanations for every decision (XAI).
6 Technology Stack

• Apache Kafka (Streaming)
6.3 Data
• Snowflake (Warehouse)
• Weaviate (Vector DB)
• Neo4j (Knowledge Graph)
• Redis (Caching)
4
6.4 Infrastructure
• Docker
• Kubernetes (GKE)
6.5 Integrations
• Shopify / Daraz APIs
• Pathao / RedX
• bKash
• WhatsApp Business API
• Facebook Graph API
6.6 Frontend
• Next.js Dashboard
• Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardised local integrations
7 10× Innovation Feature: The “Haggling Twin”
7.1 Concept
A Digital Twin + Negotiation Bot designed uniquely for South Asian commerce culture,
where haggling is standard.
7.2 How It Works
• Runs 1,000 simulations using a merchant’s digital twin (historical buyer data).
• Predicts outcomes before applying discounts or price changes.
7.3 Negotiation Example
• Customer: “Too high, 500?”
• Bot checks:
– Floor price
– Margin curves
5
– Past negotiation success patterns
• Reply: “Simulated: 98% success at 520 for two. Deal?”
7.4 Impact
• Reduces returns by 30%
• Builds trust with “Safe to apply?” previews
• Culturally aligned automation for COD-heavy markets
8 Implementation & Scaling Roadmap
8.1 Hackathon MVP (Weekend)
• Build COD Shield API
• Build basic Haggling Bot on WhatsApp with mock inventory
• Provide interactive demo flows
8.2 Phase 1: Hyper-Local Pilot (Dhaka, Months 1–3)
• Target 50 F-commerce merchants
• Focus on inventory alerts + fraud detection
• Metric: 15% stockout reduction
8.3 Phase 2: National Platform (Months 4–12)
• Full Shopify/Daraz integrations
• Launch Haggling Twin
• Metric: $1M GMV processed
8.4 Phase 3: Global South Expansion (Year 2)
• Adapt to Indonesia (Tokopedia) & Nigeria (Jumia)
• Localize NLP to Bahasa and Yoruba
• Open API for more marketplaces

9 Governance & Ethics Framework
9.1 Fairness Filters & Price Guardrails
• Pricing capped at MSRP
• Anti-gouging: <15% price hikes during disasters
• No favoritism for large suppliers
9.2 Bias Resistance & Data Sovereignty
• Models audited for SME fairness
• PII hashed locally before cloud sync
9.3 Explainability (XAI)
• “Why?” button for every recommendation
